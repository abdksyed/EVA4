**Link for Assignments:**

### Assignment A - OpenCV Yolo:

- Run [this](https://pysource.com/2019/06/27/yolo-object-detection-using-opencv-with-python/) code on your laptop or Colab. 
- Take an image of yourself, holding another object which is there in COCO data set (search for COCO classes to learn). 
- Run this image through the code above. 
- Upload the link to GitHub implementation of this

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/abksyed/EVA4/blob/master/13_YoloV3/Yolo_OpenCV/yolo_object_detection.py) for Assignment A(OpenCV YOLO)

### Assignment B - Training Custom Dataset on Colab for YoloV3

- Refer to this Colab File: LINK (Links to an external site.)
- Refer to this GitHub Repo (Links to an external site.)
- Collect a dataset of 500 images and annotate them. Please select a class for which you can find a YouTube video as well. Steps are explained in the readme.md file on GitHub.
- Once done:
    - Download (Links to an external site.) a very small (~10-30sec) video from youtube which shows your class. 
    - Use ffmpeg (Links to an external site.) to extract frames from the video. 
    - Upload on your drive (alternatively you could be doing all of this on your drive to save upload time)
    - Inter on these images using detect.py file.
    - *'python detect.py --conf-thres 0.1 --output output_folder_name'*
    - Use ffmpeg (Links to an external site.) to convert the files in your output folder to video
    - Upload the video to YouTube.
